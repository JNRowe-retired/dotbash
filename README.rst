=====

This is just my bash_ and readline_ configuration files that are shared
between hosts.  Maybe they're useful to you too, or better yet maybe
you'll spot *and* fix a bug!

If you find any problems with the configuration files in this repository
either drop me an email_ or file an issue_.  Locally, bugs are managed
with `Bugs Everywhere`_, so if you're working with a clone of the
repository you can report, list and fix bugs directly in the
repository [#]_.

.. [#] If you're using Gentoo_ you can find an ebuild for `Bugs Everywhere`_, in my overlay_.
